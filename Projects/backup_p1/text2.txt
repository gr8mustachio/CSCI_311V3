Abstract The diagnosis of mental disorder initially appears relatively straightforward Patients present with symptoms or visible signs of illness health professionals make diagnoses based primarily on these symptoms and signs and they prescribe medication, psychotherapy, or both, accordingly. 
However, despite a dramatic expansion of knowledge about mental disorders during the past half century, understanding of their components and processes remains rudimentary.
We provide histories and descriptions of three systems with different purposes relevant to understanding and classifying mental disorder.
